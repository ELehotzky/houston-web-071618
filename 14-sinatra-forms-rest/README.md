## Summer Camp Schedule

Every year, WeWork hosts Summer Camp for all employees. Summer Camp is a WeWork tradition—a shared experience and opportunity for team members from every region to come together. This year’s Summer Camp will be Thursday, August 16 to Sunday, August 19. This means that there will be limited staffing beginning on Wednesday, August 15 until Friday, August 17 to allot for staff travel to Summer Camp.

We are committed to supporting your learning and progress and have developed a plan to ensure that you will experience the same programming during this time. This falls on a Week 2 and depending on your module, there will be some adjustments in the date on which you’ll take your code challenges and alterations to assignments. These changes will be communicated to you well in advance by your Lead Instructor(s).

Things to keep in mind:

*Campus will still be accessible 24-hours a day.

*Student attendance on Thursday, August 16 and Friday, August 17 will be optional, however assignments are still required to be completed and may require pair or group work.

*2 members of the instructional team will be available to assist with any questions during those 2 days.

Should you have any questions or feedback, please contact your Senior Program Manager.
