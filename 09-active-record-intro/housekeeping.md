- Code Challenge thoughts
  1. Friday will be harder
  2. What we are looking for: Confidence that you...
    - are comfortable with using a runner/console file to iteratively make and test changes (debugging skills)
    - are comfortable with implementing relations in models (e.g., Passenger#tickets, Passenger#flights, Flights#tickets, Flights#passengers)
    - are comfortable with array methods (each vs. collect/map vs. select vs. find)
  3. The learning process
    A. Lectures - introduction/exposure to topic, demonstration without tests
    B. Labs - lots of scaffolding/support to learn the topic
    C. Mastery/Independence - Be fully comfortable with the material apart from labs/tests
  4. Responsibilities
    - We are here to provide as much help and support as you need
    - We will continue to move forward with the material, which will not get easier
    - Some of you may need to do (lots of?) extra work/practice (after hours?) to both keep up and reach Mastery/Independence
  5. Retaking is okay and normal
    - Module 1 is a good one to retake
- Introduction to ActiveRecord
